  <p>In the context of biology, cell analysis refers to computational and statistical methods to attract data from images.</p>
  <p>It involves image analysis techniques like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cell Finding (Segmentation) - Identifies each individual type of cell in the image.</li>
    <li>Measuring Features (Extraction) - Measures the cellâ€™s size, shape, etc.</li>
    <li>Counting/Summarizing (Statistics) - Measures cell count, area, and etc.</li>
  </ul>
