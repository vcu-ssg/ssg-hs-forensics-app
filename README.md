# SSG - App for High School forensics exercises

We're building an app to automate the current manual process of running facebookresearch/segment-anything library.


## FOLDERS

* ./sample-images : this is where a bunch of sample images are stored.  These are the source images, edited or processed images should not be stored in this folder.

* ./sample-code : contains the sample python and collab/jupyter files provided by Alina.

* ./reports : this is where our initial quarto reports/qmd files should be stored.  The file contains the source files for the website, too.

* ./reports/index.qmd : this is the source code for the *index.html* website home page.

* ./docs : do not edit files in this folder.  This folder is created automatically by quarto or other tools and is used by GH-PAGES for presentation of project website.

* ./src : source code for any app(s) that we create.
