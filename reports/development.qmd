title: Developer Documentation
---

NOTE 1 - TODO: We likely need to adjust the images folder. The sample gallery images should also contain the processed gallery images so (1) users don't need to wait for sample images to be processed and (2) the processed gallery images are kept separate from the user processed images.

NOTE 2: What else needs to be added to this page of documentation? I don't want to get too into the weeds, especially since a lot of information for developers should be found in comments near the code in question.



## Who This Page Is For

This section of the documentation is intended for developers or those who are hoping to look under the hood of this project. If you know little about coding or are trying to figure out how to add your own lessons to the application, then this section of documentation is NOT for you. If you are looking for documentation about how to make your own lesson, please see `ADD DOCUMENTATION NAME`.



## Location of Files

These file locations will be relative to the root directory (`ssg-hs-forensics-app/`).

`forensics-ui/` - contains the files used to generate the graphics (the actual website itself). Within this directory:
 * `_site/` - contains the rendered pages of the website.
 * `.quarto` - contains the intermediate files generated by Quarto before the files in '_site/' are created. (DOUBLE CHECK THAT THIS IS CORRECT)
 * `cell-gallery/` - contains the Quarto/QMD and CSS files needed to generate the interactive cell gallery; whenever the 'process' button is pressed, it sends the specific image to the backend for processing and retrieves the processed image.
 * `lesson-1/` - contains the QMD and CSS files needed to generate the lesson pages of the first lesson.
 * `upload/` - contains the QMD and CSS files responsible for upload functionality; sends uploaded images to the backend for processing and retrieves the results.
 * `_quarto.yml` - file responsible for coordinating the other files for the front-end, and provides the website bar necessary to navigate the different pages of the website.

`forensics-backend/` - contains the files that manage the whole system and process uploaded images. Within this directory:
 * `app/` - contains the following files:
    - `Dockerfile` - manages setting up the Docker compartments and running the server.
    - `main.py` - contains the server functions, which allow images to be processed and retrieved.
    - `requirements.txt` - contains the names of Python libraries required for this project; 'Dockerfile' uses this file to know what libraries to install when setting up the Docker compartments and webserver.
    - `run_sam2.py` - responsible for processing uploaded images; used by 'main.py'.
 * `nginx/` - contains the following file:
    - `default.conf` - configurations for the Docker compartments; manages pathways between systems, including connecting containers to the outside world and rerouting calls to their intended compartments.
 * `docker-compose.yml` - responsible for Docker container creation, and leaves 'windows' open so files outside certain compartments can be used.

`images/` - contains the images used in the website. Within this directory:
 * `processed-images/` - contains the processed images (images that have been run through the SAM model).
 * `sample-gallery-images/` - contains the sample images that are pre-loaded into the gallery.
 * `uploaded-images/` - contains the images users have uploaded.

`reports/` - contains the QMD files that render into the documentation for this project. Within this directory: (TODO: ADD TO)
 * `development.qmd` - the file that renders this very file; documentation indended for developers or those who are interested in the behind-the-scenes information.



## Overview of Coding Languages Used

This project primarily uses Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (through Quarto). The actual processing of files relies on Python code. JavaScript is used within the QMD (Quarto) files in order to add interactivity to the generated HTML pages, including APIs that allow images to be sent to the backend server for processing and to request images from the server. Quarto is used to generate the HTML files that make up the website.
